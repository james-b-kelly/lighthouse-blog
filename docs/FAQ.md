### Can I order a print from TrailArt.store?

We provide an easy way to create a printable image commemorating or celebrating a hike, run, walk, or road trip. We don't currently offer printing services.

We do give you advice when ordering what size of product to look for.

This is for two reasons:

- It allows us focus on the design tool that lets you customise your artwork, and the presets designs that make it quick and easy.
- It lets you choose where you order your printed product from, saving you a middle man fee that we would otherwise have to impose to support delivery & returns.

### My friend/partner did a marathon, how do I get their GPS route into Trailart.store?

There are a couple of ways:

1. If they used a fitness app like Strava, Garmin Connect, or MapMyRun, they can export their activity as a GPX file and send it to you.
2. If they used Strava and you follow them, you can get their GPX from the activity page on the Strava.com **website** (not the app).
   1. Go to Strava.com and sign in.
   2. Go to the page from the run/hike you want to use.
   3. On the left-hand side of the page in the toolbar, click the button with **three dots**.
   4. Click _Export GPX_.

Once you have the GPX file on your computer, start a project on TrailArt.store and in the **Route Line** click the _I have a .GPX file_ option.

### I did a multi-day hike (or road trip) but I don't have GPS data of it. Can I create a route line somehow?

If you took a lot of photos on your iPhone along the way, yes! You can use our TrailArt iOS app to do it.

- Download the app.
- Sign in to your TrailArt account.
- Tap the _Route Line_ option, then _Route From Photos_.
- Choose the first and last photos from your trip.
- A line will be created from the GPS coordinates of those photos.

### I can't see a map color or style that really suits what I have in mind.

Feel free to fire off a quick email to support@trailart.store with what you have in mind - images, colors, styles - and we'll be happy to add a style to the editor that suits your needs.

We use a mapping service called MapBox. This lets us style our maps quite extensively. If you know how to edit map styles on MapBox.com yourself, you can provide us with your map style ID and we can add it to our design collection.

### I ordered a project and I notice I made a mistake - I left a label blank or used the wrong photo. Can I get a refund?

If you've made a typo or some other mistake in your design **and** you've made a second order (from copying your first order) with the elements fixed, then we'll be happy to refund the first order for you.

If you make a second order from copying the first and made _substantial_ changes, then we may not be able to offer a refund.

### The final image after checkout is not what I saw during the design. Can I get a refund?

Send an email to support@trailart.store explaining your issues and we will see what we can do.
